DarshanaC so how are we supposed to change pdt
bear hehehe - I don't quite know just yet :)
DarshanaC hmmm
bear but I think I will have to add some helper functions
bear that can take the locale info and scan the text being passed in
bear to identify any date related locale clues
DarshanaC hmmm
DarshanaC can we pass the locale as an input to parse() alongwith the text
bear one problem is that I think big chunks of text are being passed to pdt to let it find the dates
DarshanaC that is locale info is present
bear yea - pdt will need to change so that it caches any pdc objects that are created
bear I think a new entry point will be useful
bear give it a new block of text and have it scan for date/time possibilities
bear and then return a list of them with the parsed results
* DarshanaC nods
bear that could be where the locale work can be handled - that way the core code doesn't have to change much
DarshanaC true
bear and it could just be a simple list of words that can be date/time along with position, then make a pass to gather them into groups based on distance to each other
bear set the distance threshold to something like 4 or 5 words and it may give a nice natural distribution
bear would need to test that to find a good threshold value
DarshanaC this is going to be complicated
bear yep - for sure
DarshanaC :(
bear it borders on NLP
bear I think we could make do with a brute force item first
bear get a list of patterns that fit 80%
bear thinks like <month abbr> ## or year
bear and then just add 2-3 words in front and behind
bear do a quick check for overlaps and then make that the list
DarshanaC we have to make sure that we dont mistake date/time ranges for 2 sperate date/times
bear then the locale code can loop over the text for the system locale and english - if a hit is found go with it
bear yea 
bear but that can be part of the overlap check
DarshanaC ok
bear if the range trigger is found inbetween two groups then just group them
DarshanaC hmm
bear let me get some test code for this in the repository
bear that way you don't have to spend a lot of time on it (unless you want to :)
bear and then you can test it by trying to fit it into the bug fix
DarshanaC I dont know how i am going to get time to work on this.. I am defending my MS on 05/24 and starting my new job on 05/29
DarshanaC have to work on this on weekends :)
bear no worries - I can do the up front part - that way you can integrate it
DarshanaC ok
bear yea - this doesn't have to be done next week
bear just before preview ships :)
DarshanaC when is that?
bear and that won't be for a month
DarshanaC ok
DarshanaC will talk to you.. need to have lunch now
DarshanaC later
bear same here - later!
DarshanaC bye
